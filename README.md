### Make and manage everything! 

The entire website is build to help the user. It features multiple aspects like stock management, order processing and many more

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the process I used to create the final website. I started by looking at multiple examples of what I wanted to create or how I wanted to design the website.  After creating wireframes I got an idea of how I wanted to design the website.  I then went on to implement the functionality of the website, and style the website.

### Inspiration

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* Implemented `Node.js`, `Express.js` and `Mongo DB Atlas` to create the main system
* Added additional user security with`JWT Authentication`

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* This was a fun and interesting process, although it was a ver intense project to learn and implement react within the given time period. I do believe it was worth it and a very good experience.

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* The group was the major obstacle, but after speaking with my lecturer, I made the decision to develop my own web application.
* I created all the code from scratch and added a few extra features that I thought would enhance the web application.

#### Above And Beyond

Additional features that I implemented into the brief.
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* I modified the system so that a "guest viewer" will be able to browse the website and examine the queries being posed by other users.
* I also made the website adaptable so that its design and functionality alter depending on whether or not a user is logged in.
* I implemented user customization, which enables users to modify their avatars and update their personal information. However, I also created avatars that alter depending on the year the user is currently in, giving them a variety of alternatives.

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* I want to expand the website's functionality in the future by adding features like user reporting and tag searching.

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
